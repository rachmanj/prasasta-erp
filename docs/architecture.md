Purpose: Technical reference for understanding system design and development patterns
Last Updated: 2025-01-27

## Architecture Documentation Guidelines

### Document Purpose

This document describes the CURRENT WORKING STATE of the application architecture. It serves as:

- Technical reference for understanding how the system currently works
- Onboarding guide for new developers
- Design pattern documentation for consistent development
- Schema and data flow documentation reflecting actual implementation

### What TO Include

- **Current Technology Stack**: Technologies actually in use
- **Working Components**: Components that are implemented and functional
- **Actual Database Schema**: Tables, fields, and relationships as they exist
- **Implemented Data Flows**: How data actually moves through the system
- **Working API Endpoints**: Routes that are active and functional
- **Deployment Patterns**: How the system is actually deployed
- **Security Measures**: Security implementations that are active

### What NOT to Include

- **Issues or Bugs**: These belong in `MEMORY.md` with technical debt entries
- **Limitations or Problems**: Document what IS working, not what isn't
- **Future Plans**: Enhancement ideas belong in `backlog.md`
- **Deprecated Features**: Remove outdated information rather than marking as deprecated
- **Wishlist Items**: Planned features that aren't implemented yet

### Update Guidelines

- **Reflect Reality**: Always document the actual current state, not intended state
- **Schema Notes**: When database schema has unused fields, note them factually
- **Cross-Reference**: Link to other docs when appropriate, but don't duplicate content

### For AI Coding Agents

- **Investigate Before Updating**: Use codebase search to verify current implementation
- **Move Issues to Memory**: If you discover problems, document them in `MEMORY.md`
- **Factual Documentation**: Describe what exists, not what should exist

# System Architecture

## Project Overview

[Brief description of what this system does]

## Technology Stack (Current)

- **Backend**: Laravel 12, PHP 8.2, MySQL, Spatie Laravel Permission, AdminLTE 3
- **Auth**: Custom AdminLTE login/logout (Breeze removed), Spatie roles/permissions
- **UI**: AdminLTE layout used on Dashboard, Trial Balance, GL Detail, Manual Journal, Admin RBAC
- **Services**: `App\Services\Reports\ReportService` and `App\Services\Accounting\PostingService`
  - Additional: `App\Services\PdfService` for DomPDF rendering

## Core Components (Implemented)

- General Ledger foundation
  - Migrations: `accounts`, `journals`, `journal_lines`, `periods`
  - Dimensions: `projects`, `funds`, `departments`
    - Management UI: DataTables + modal CRUD for Projects, Funds, Departments with permission gates; deletion blocked when referenced (funds also blocked if linked to projects)
  - Masters: `customers`, `vendors`, `tax_codes`, `bank_accounts`, `bank_transactions`
  - Seeders: `CoASeeder`, `TaxCodeSeeder`, `FundProjectSeeder`, `RolePermissionSeeder` (admin assigned to admin@example.com)
- RBAC: Spatie roles/permissions (`admin`, `accountant`, `approver`, `cashier`, `auditor`)
- Reports: Trial Balance and GL Detail endpoints via `ReportsController` + `ReportService`
  - Added AR/AP Aging and Cash Ledger with modernized UI layouts and professional export functionality
  - All reports now use consistent AdminLTE layout structure with content headers, breadcrumbs, and card layouts
  - Indonesian number formatting (17.000.000,00) with right-aligned columns using Intl.NumberFormat('id-ID')
  - Professional export dropdowns with CSV/PDF options for all reports
  - AJAX-based reports (GL Detail, Trial Balance, Cash Ledger, AR/AP Aging) with CSRF token handling
  - Server-side reports (AR/AP Party Balances, Withholding Recap) with responsive table layouts
  - Aging enhanced to use `due_date` (terms) when available and to report outstanding net of settlements via allocations
- Journals: Each journal has unique `journal_no` generated as `JNL-YYYYMM-######`
- Journal Status Workflow: Journals start in `draft` status, only approvers can post them to `posted` status
- Journal Approval Interface: Dedicated approval page with DataTables, search filters, and SweetAlert confirmations
- Period Close: `PeriodCloseService` to close/open months; PostingService blocks posting into closed periods
- AR scaffolding: Sales Invoices (draft→posted) with PostingService hook creating AR/Revenue(+PPN) entries
- AP scaffolding: Purchase Invoices (draft→posted) with PostingService hook creating Expense/Asset(+PPN Input) and AP entries
- Cash Movements: Sales Receipts (settle AR), Purchase Payments (settle AP)
  - Allocation tables `sales_receipt_allocations` and `purchase_payment_allocations` for per-invoice allocations (auto oldest-first)
- Upstream Docs: Sales Orders (SO), Purchase Orders (PO), Goods Receipts (GR)
  - Minimal flow implemented to capture pre-invoice intent and receipts
  - Status workflow: SO/PO (draft→approved→closed), GR (draft→received)
  - Auto-numbering: All documents use consistent `PREFIX-YYYYMM-######` format
    - Purchase Orders: `PO-YYYYMM-######` (e.g., PO-202501-000001)
    - Sales Orders: `SO-YYYYMM-######` (e.g., SO-202501-000001)
    - Purchase Invoices: `PINV-YYYYMM-######` (e.g., PINV-202501-000001)
    - Sales Invoices: `SINV-YYYYMM-######` (e.g., SINV-202501-000001)
    - Purchase Payments: `PP-YYYYMM-######` (e.g., PP-202501-000001)
    - Sales Receipts: `SR-YYYYMM-######` (e.g., SR-202501-000001)
    - Asset Disposals: `DIS-YYYYMM-######` (e.g., DIS-202501-000001)
    - Goods Receipts: `GR-YYYYMM-######` (e.g., GR-202501-000001)
    - Cash Expenses: `CEV-YYYYMM-######` (e.g., CEV-202501-000001)
    - Journals: `JNL-YYYYMM-######` (e.g., JNL-202501-000001)
  - "Create Invoice" actions on SO/GR/PO prefill Sales/Purchase Invoice create forms
  - Linkage: `sales_invoices.sales_order_id`, `purchase_invoices.purchase_order_id`, `purchase_invoices.goods_receipt_id` populated on prefill and shown on invoice pages
  - Quantity summary: PO and GR show pages display ordered vs received quantities

  - `reverseJournal(journalId, date?, postedBy?)` posts a reversal journal
  - Validations: required keys, non-negative amounts, lines present, balanced sum
  - Status Management: Journals created as `draft`, only approvers can post to `posted` status

## UI (Current Screens)

- Dashboard: AdminLTE boxes (Accounts, Journals, Projects, Parties), User Information card displaying name, email, username, roles (as badges), permissions count, and login timestamp
- Reports: Trial Balance, GL Detail, AR/AP Aging, Cash Ledger, AR/AP Party Balances, Withholding Recap
  - Modernized UI with consistent AdminLTE layout structure, content headers, and breadcrumbs
  - Professional export dropdowns with CSV/PDF options and proper number formatting
  - AJAX-based reports with CSRF token handling and Indonesian locale number formatting
  - Responsive table layouts with right-aligned numeric columns
- Journals: Manual Journal (balanced validation), Journals Index (shows `journal_no`, server-side DataTables with date/description filters and reverse action). DataTables JSON now includes `id` to build action URLs reliably.
- Journal Approval: Dedicated approval interface (`/journals/approval`) with DataTables listing draft journals, search filters (date range, description), SweetAlert confirmation dialogs, and direct approval workflow
- Admin: Users Index (create/edit pages), Roles Index (create/edit pages, badges for permissions), Permissions Index
- Masters: Customers and Suppliers with DataTables and modal create/edit forms

- Sales: Sales Orders (list/create/show with DataTables list and prefill to Sales Invoice)
- Purchase: Purchase Orders (list/create/show), Goods Receipts (list/create/show) with prefill to Purchase Invoice

### UI Components & Assets

- **Select2BS4 Integration**: Local AdminLTE assets used for enhanced dropdown functionality
  - CSS: `adminlte/plugins/select2/css/select2.min.css` and `adminlte/plugins/select2-bootstrap4-theme/select2-bootstrap4.min.css`
  - JS: `adminlte/plugins/select2/js/select2.full.min.js`
  - Class: `select2bs4` for Bootstrap 4 theme integration
  - Initialization: Proper timeout handling and memory management for dynamic content
- **Form Enhancements**: Input groups with icons, responsive layouts, visual feedback indicators
- **Data Formatting**: Thousand separators for amounts, proper number formatting, real-time validation feedback

### UI Notes

- Admin index pages initialize DataTables using `@section('scripts')` blocks rendered by layout `@yield('scripts')`.
- Layout `layouts/partials/scripts.blade.php` includes both `@yield('scripts')` and `@stack('scripts')` for compatibility.
- Select2BS4 components require proper initialization timing and cleanup to prevent memory leaks in dynamic content.

```

## Security Implementation

- Session auth via Laravel `web` guard; `auth` middleware on all app routes
- Spatie Permission for RBAC, middleware aliases registered in `bootstrap/app.php`
- Admin area gated by `permission:view-admin`; feature routes use granular permissions (e.g., `journals.view`, `journals.create`, `journals.reverse`, `reports.view`)
- CSRF protection enabled; POST actions (e.g., reverse) use `@csrf`
- No public registration/reset; admins manage users in Admin UI
- Input validation on posting (dates, amounts, relationships) and server-side DataTables filtering

### Route-level permissions (current)

- `journals.index`, `journals.data`: `journals.view`
- `journals.manual.create`, `journals.manual.store`: `journals.create`
- `journals.reverse`: `journals.reverse`
- Reports endpoints: `reports.view`
- Dimensions endpoints:
  - Projects: `projects.view`, `projects.manage`
  - Funds: `funds.view`, `funds.manage`
  - Departments: `departments.view`, `departments.manage`

## Deployment

- PHP 8.2+, Laravel 12 app under `backend/`
- Environment: `.env` with MySQL; queues/mail optional for Phase 1
- Assets: AdminLTE vendor assets in `public/`; no Vite pipeline required
- Run migrations/seeders: `php artisan migrate --seed` (CoA, Roles/Permissions, demo journals)
- Web server: Nginx/Apache pointing to `public/index.php`; HTTPS recommended

## Quality & Tests

- PostingService feature tests: balanced/unbalanced validation, negative/zero amount rejection, reversal creates contra lines, dimensions preserved
- Reports feature tests: Trial Balance totals equality; GL Detail filters by account/date
- Journal number format test: validates `JNL-YYYYMM-######` pattern

## Timezone Policy

- Storage: UTC at database level
- Display: Convert to `Asia/Singapore` (UTC+8) at presentation layer (Blade/helpers)

## Proposed ERD (Pending Approval)

The following ERD outlines the target bookkeeping data model for a Yayasan (non‑profit) with double‑entry accounting, fund/project dimensions, and AR/AP subledgers. This describes the intended Phase 1 schema and is pending implementation approval.

### Core Tables (Phase 1 target)

- Accounts: id, code, name, type (asset/liability/net_assets/income/expense), is_postable, parent_id
- Journals: id, journal_no, date, description, status (draft/posted/reversed), period_id, source_type, source_id, posted_by, posted_at
- JournalLines: id, journal_id, account_id, debit, credit, project_id, fund_id, dept_id, memo
- Periods: id, month, year, is_closed, closed_at
- Projects: id, code, name, start_date, end_date, fund_id, budget_total, status
- Funds: id, code, name, is_restricted
- Departments: id, code, name
- TaxCodes: id, code, name, type (ppn_output/ppn_input/withholding), rate
- Customers: id, code, name, npwp, address, phone, email
- Vendors: id, code, name, npwp, address, phone, email
- SalesOrders, SalesOrderLines
- SalesInvoices, SalesInvoiceLines
- SalesReceipts
- PurchaseOrders, PurchaseOrderLines
- PurchaseInvoices, PurchaseInvoiceLines
- PurchasePayments
- BankAccounts, BankTransactions

Notes:

- Double‑entry integrity enforced by balanced `JournalLines` per `Journal`.
- Journals reference business documents via `source_type` + `source_id`.
- Dimensions (project, fund, department) live on `JournalLines` for granular reporting.
- Taxes stored at line‑level via `tax_code_id` where applicable.

## Reporting

- Withholding Recap uses per-invoice rounding (ROUND(sum per invoice, 2) then vendor totals)
