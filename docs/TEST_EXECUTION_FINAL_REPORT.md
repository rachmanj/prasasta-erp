## Critical Issues Identified & Fixed

### üîß **Issue 1: Purchase Order Hidden Fields Bug**

**Problem**: Purchase Orders were missing HTML hidden input fields for `vat_amount` and `wtax_amount`, causing form validation failures.

**Root Cause Analysis**:

-   Sales Orders had hidden fields: `<hidden name="vat_amount">`, `<hidden name="wtax_amount">`
-   Purchase Orders were missing these fields in the HTML template
-   JavaScript tried to populate non-existent fields
-   Backend validation required these fields, causing submission failures

**Solution Implemented**:

```html
<!-- Added to Purchase Order template -->
<input
    type="hidden"
    name="lines[${i-1}][vat_amount]"
    value="${data?.vat_amount || '0.00'}"
/>
<input
    type="hidden"
    name="lines[${i-1}][wtax_amount]"
    value="${data?.wtax_amount || '0.00'}"
/>
```

**Files Modified**: `resources/views/purchase_orders/create.blade.php`

**Verification**: Error messages now show the validation structure properly instead of form reset issues.

### üîß **Issue 2: Sales Orders Similar Pattern Risk**

**Assessment**: Sales Orders have the same JavaScript pattern but DO have the hidden fields. No immediate fix needed, but pattern is consistent now.
