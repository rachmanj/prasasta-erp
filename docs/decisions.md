-   2025-12-15 (Post-launch optimization and enhancement planning)

Decision: Withholding recap rounding granularity (per-invoice) - [2025-09-09]

Context:

-   Totals can differ by a few cents depending on whether rounding is applied per line, per invoice, or only at the vendor aggregate.

Options Considered:

1. Per-line: ROUND(amount×rate) per line, then sum
    - ✅ Matches documents that round at line level
    - ❌ Larger drift vs total
2. Per-invoice: ROUND(SUM(lines×rate), 2) per invoice, then sum by vendor
    - ✅ Balanced approach; matches typical invoice-level rounding
    - ❌ Can still differ from pure aggregate by a few cents
3. Per-vendor aggregate: ROUND(SUM(all lines×rate), 2)
    - ✅ Cleanest totals
    - ❌ May not match invoice subtotals

Decision:

-   Use per-invoice rounding.

Implementation:

-   `ReportService::getWithholdingRecap()` computes per-invoice withholding via subquery with `ROUND(SUM(...),2)` grouped by invoice, then sums per vendor.

Review Date:

-   2025-10-15 (adjust if tax authority guidance prefers per-line).

Decision: Introduce SO/PO/GRN upstream docs with invoice prefill - [2025-09-08]

Context:

-   Need upstream documents to capture intent and received goods/services prior to invoicing, and speed invoice creation.

Options Considered:

1. Skip upstream docs and create invoices directly
    - ✅ Simpler data model
    - ❌ Loses operational context; slower invoicing; no separation of ordering/receiving
2. Add minimal SO/PO/GRN with prefill to invoices
    - ✅ Preserves operational trail; improves UX; minimal complexity
    - ❌ Adds a few tables and views to maintain

Decision:

-   Implement minimal Sales Orders, Purchase Orders, and Goods Receipts with "Create Invoice" actions that prefill Sales/Purchase Invoice forms.

Implementation:

-   Added controllers, routes, and blades for SO/PO/GRN; DataTables list endpoints in routes; sidebar links under Sales/Purchase.
-   Prefill logic passes party and line items into existing invoice create views.

Review Date:

-   2025-10-15 (consider approvals, statuses, and links back to invoices).

Decision: Party balance statement pages (AR/AP) - [2025-09-08]

Context:

-   Need a quick overview of per-party balances to drive reconciliation and follow-ups.

Options Considered:

1. Use only aging reports
    - ✅ Already available
    - ❌ Hard to see totals per party at a glance
2. Add party balance summary pages + exports
    - ✅ Fast overview, CSV/PDF distribution, drill-down links
    - ❌ Another UI surface to maintain

Decision:

-   Add AR/AP Party Balances pages with CSV/PDF export and drill-down links to aging.

Implementation:

-   New endpoints `/reports/ar-balances`, `/reports/ap-balances`; basic blades; menu entries in Reports.

Review Date:

-   2025-10-01 (assess need for statement PDFs per party).

Decision: Dimensions management UI pattern (DataTables + modals) - [2025-09-08]

Context:

-   Need CRUD for Projects, Funds, Departments to support tagging of journal lines and reporting by dimensions.

Options Considered:

1. Dedicated create/edit pages per entity
    - ✅ Full-page validation UX
    - ❌ Slower workflow for frequent small edits
2. Modal-based CRUD on index (DataTables)
    - ✅ Fast inline editing; consistent with Customers/Vendors
    - ❌ Limited complex validation layout

Decision:

-   Use DataTables index with modal forms for Projects, Funds, Departments. Keep controllers slim with AJAX JSON responses.

Rationale:

-   Mirrors existing master data UX; faster entry for small entities; minimal navigation overhead.

Implementation:

-   Routes `/projects`, `/funds`, `/departments` with `*.data` endpoints.
-   Permissions: `projects.view/manage`, `funds.view/manage`, `departments.view/manage` added to seeder; sidebar links gated by permissions.
-   Prevent deletion if referenced by `journal_lines` (and `projects` for funds).

Review Date:

-   2025-10-15 (evaluate bulk import/export and advanced filters).

Decision: PHP concatenation in action buttons (consistency rule) - [2025-09-08]

Context:

-   A 500 error occurred due to using `+` instead of `.` for string concatenation when composing DataTables action HTML in Funds/Departments controllers.

Decision:

-   Enforce using `.` for PHP string concatenation in all action builders; add linter/code review note.

Implementation:

-   Fixed in `FundController` and `DepartmentController`; verified pages load.

Review Date:

-   2025-09-20 (ensure no similar patterns elsewhere).

Decision: Admin CRUD UX uses separate create/edit pages (no modals) - [2025-09-07]

Context:

-   Modals limited validation UX and deep forms; the user prefers dedicated pages for clarity and accessibility.

Options Considered:

1. Keep modal-based create/edit on index pages
    - ✅ Quick interactions
    - ❌ Poor form validation UX, cramped UI, complex JS
2. Switch to dedicated create/edit pages
    - ✅ Cleaner forms, simpler controllers/routes, better accessibility
    - ❌ Requires navigation away from list

Decision:

-   Implement create/edit pages for Users and Roles. Index pages remain list-only with links to forms.

Rationale:

-   Improves maintainability, validation, and user experience with AdminLTE forms.

Implementation:

-   Routes added: `/admin/users/create`, `/admin/users/{user}/edit`, `/admin/roles/create`, `/admin/roles/{role}/edit`.
-   Controllers updated with `create`/`edit` methods; DataTables actions now use anchor links.
-   Permissions page remains modal-based for now.

Review Date:

-   2025-10-01 (revisit unifying patterns across all admin pages).

Decision: Render page scripts via `@section('scripts')` on Admin pages - [2025-09-07]

Context:

-   DataTables scripts weren't executing because layout only yielded `@yield('scripts')` while views used `@push('scripts')`.

Decision:

-   Standardize on `@section('scripts')` for Admin pages; layout now supports both `@yield('scripts')` and `@stack('scripts')`.

Implementation:

-   Updated Users/Roles/Permissions index views to use `@section('scripts')`.
-   Updated `layouts/partials/scripts.blade.php` to include `@stack('scripts')`.

Decision: Replace Breeze with AdminLTE auth - [2025-09-07]

Context:

-   We standardized the UI on AdminLTE and wanted to remove Breeze scaffolding to reduce duplication.

Options Considered:

1. Keep Breeze for auth views alongside AdminLTE
    - ✅ Minimal work
    - ❌ Inconsistent UX, duplicated layouts
2. Remove Breeze and implement AdminLTE login/logout
    - ✅ Consistent UX and simpler stack
    - ❌ Need to wire custom routes & views

Decision:

-   Removed Breeze package and routes; added AdminLTE-based login/logout using `AuthenticatedSessionController`.

Rationale:

-   Consistent look-and-feel and leaner dependencies.

Implementation:

-   `/login` (GET/POST) and `/logout` (POST) routes defined in `routes/web.php`.
-   Dashboard and core pages converted to `layouts.main`.

Review Date:

-   2025-11-01 or when adding registration/password flows.

Decision: Enforce no self-registration (Admin-created users only) - [2025-09-08]

Context:

-   We standardized on AdminLTE-only auth without public registration. Some register routes remained enabled.

Options Considered:

1. Keep register routes for admin-assisted flows
    - ✅ Allows manual onboarding via UI
    - ❌ Conflicts with decision, increases attack surface
2. Disable public registration entirely
    - ✅ Matches policy and reduces risk
    - ❌ Admins must create users via Admin UI only

Decision:

-   Disable self-registration routes; admins create users in Admin area.

Implementation:

-   Removed `GET /register` and `POST /register` routes from `routes/web.php` guest group.

Review Date:

-   2025-11-01 (revisit if we add invite-based flows).

Decision: Accounting model and technology stack - [2025-09-07]

Decision: Authentication approach — AdminLTE-only (no self-registration/reset) - [2025-09-07]
Decision: Enforce granular RBAC on Journals routes - [2025-09-07]

Context:

-   Journals list and actions should be separately controllable for view, create, and reverse operations.

Options Considered:

1. Single `journals.manage` permission
    - ✅ Simpler to assign
    - ❌ Too coarse; hard to segregate duties
2. Granular permissions per action
    - ✅ Least privilege and clearer audits
    - ❌ Slightly more setup and testing

Decision:

-   Adopt granular permissions: `journals.view`, `journals.create`, `journals.reverse` on route middleware.

Implementation:

-   Updated `routes/web.php` group and routes to require the specific permissions.

Update - [2025-09-08]

-   Journals reversal controller method now authorizes `journals.reverse` (was `journals.create`). DataTables response now includes `id` ensuring action buttons work.

Review Date:

-   2025-10-15 (validate with user roles and audit requirements).

Decision: Foreign key integrity application strategy - [2025-09-07]

Context:

-   Need FKs for referential integrity but encountered duplicate FK names during iterative dev.

Options Considered:

1. Edit existing FK migration
    - ✅ Keeps one file
    - ❌ Not applied if already run; breaks migrate:fresh expectations
2. Add follow-up FK migration and make adds idempotent
    - ✅ Works with migrate:fresh and prod-safe follow-ups
    - ❌ Additional file to track

Decision:

-   Create a follow-up migration (`add_missing_foreign_keys_phase1_2`) and make FK adds tolerant; avoid dropping non-existent keys.

Implementation:

-   Added `projects.fund_id` and confirmed `journal_lines` dimension FKs; ensured `journals.period_id` FK applied cleanly.

Review Date:

-   2025-11-01 or after Phase 2 schema changes.

Decision: Period close policy and enforcement - [2025-09-08]

Context:

-   Require control to prevent postings into closed accounting periods.

Options Considered:

1. Enforce at DB trigger level
    - ✅ Strong enforcement
    - ❌ Harder to test/migrate
2. Enforce at service layer (PostingService)
    - ✅ Testable, simple, centralized
    - ❌ Requires discipline for all postings to go through service

Decision:

-   Enforce at PostingService using `PeriodCloseService::isDateClosed()`.

Implementation:

-   Added `PeriodCloseService` (close/open/list), routes and UI; PostingService throws when posting into closed periods.

Decision: AR posting rules (minimal) - [2025-09-08]

Context:

-   Need minimal AR flow to generate journals from Sales Invoices.

Decision:

-   On post: Dr Accounts Receivable (1.1.4); Cr Revenue lines; Cr PPN Keluaran (2.1.2) if tax present.

Implementation:

-   Added SalesInvoice(+lines), controller post() composing balanced lines; uses existing PostingService.

Decision: AP posting rules (minimal) - [2025-09-08]

Context:

-   Need minimal AP flow to generate journals from Purchase Invoices.

Decision:

-   On post: Dr Expense/Asset lines; Dr PPN Masukan (1.1.6) if tax present; Cr Accounts Payable (2.1.1).

Implementation:

-   Added PurchaseInvoice(+lines), controller post() composing balanced lines; uses existing PostingService. Added print views for Sales and Purchase invoices.

Decision: PDF generation approach - [2025-09-08]

Context:

-   Need simple PDF rendering for invoices/receipts/payments without adding heavy dependencies.

Options Considered:

1. barryvdh/laravel-dompdf wrapper
    - ✅ Facade + config convenience
    - ❌ Version resolution friction; not necessary for basic needs
2. Direct dompdf/dompdf
    - ✅ Works with Laravel 12; minimal surface; simple service wrapper
    - ❌ No Laravel-specific helpers

Decision:

-   Use direct `dompdf/dompdf` v2.0.8 via a thin `PdfService`.

Implementation:

-   Added `PdfService` and `GeneratePdfJob`; controllers expose `/pdf` endpoints rendering print Blade views inline.

Review Date:

-   2025-11-01 (consider adding DB constraints or summary locks if needed).

Context:

-   We standardized the UI on AdminLTE and implemented custom login/logout. Breeze scaffolding was removed to avoid duplicate layouts and flows.

Options Considered:

1. AdminLTE-only custom auth views and routes
    - ✅ Consistent UX, minimal dependencies, simpler routing
    - ❌ Lacks out-of-the-box register/reset/email verification
2. Laravel Breeze (Blade)
    - ✅ Complete templates for register/reset/verification
    - ❌ Mixed layouts with AdminLTE, adds Vite step, duplicative scaffolding

Decision:

-   Use AdminLTE-only for authentication (login/logout); disable public registration/reset flows for now.

Rationale:

-   Keeps UX consistent and codebase lean. The project does not require open registration; admins create users via RBAC UI.

Implementation:

-   Routes defined in `routes/web.php`: `GET/POST /login`, `POST /logout`. Breeze routes/views are not loaded. Guard middleware `auth` protects app routes; Spatie permission guards admin pages.

Review Date:

-   2025-11-01 or when enabling password reset/email verification is prioritized.

Context:

-   Build a bookkeeping app for a Yayasan (non‑profit) using Laravel 11, Spatie Permission, MySQL, AdminLTE. Must support double‑entry journals, AR/AP cycles, and Indonesian compliance (ISAK 35 presentation; PPN/PPh basics).

Options Considered:

1. Option A: Monolithic Laravel app with service‑layer posting engine and AdminLTE UI
    - ✅ Pros: Fast to deliver, cohesive stack, strong community support
    - ❌ Cons: Requires careful domain boundaries to avoid controller bloat
2. Option B: Microservices (separate posting engine, reporting service)
    - ✅ Pros: Scalability and isolation
    - ❌ Cons: Overkill for initial scope; higher ops complexity

Decision:

-   Adopt Option A: Monolithic Laravel with clear service boundaries (PostingService, PeriodCloseService) and dimensioned GL (project, fund, department).

Rationale:

-   Meets requirements with lowest complexity; Laravel 11 + AdminLTE enables rapid CRUD and PDF workflows; Spatie supports granular RBAC.

Implementation:

-   Proceed with Phase 1 schema, seed CoA, implement posting rules for AR/AP, role policies, and basic reports (trial balance, GL detail). Use polymorphic links from journals to source documents. Lock posted journals; reversals for corrections; period close table.

Review Date:

-   2025-11-01 or after Phase 2 kickoff (whichever comes first)

## [2025-01-27] Comprehensive ERP System Testing and Validation Decision

### Decision: Comprehensive ERP System Testing Strategy using Chrome DevTools Automation

**Context**: Need to execute comprehensive testing of the Prasasta ERP system to validate all modules, identify critical issues, and ensure production readiness with Indonesian business compliance before deployment.

**Options Considered**:

1. **Unit and Integration Testing Only**
    - ✅ Fast validation of individual components
    - ❌ Doesn't validate real-world user workflows or Indonesian business compliance
2. **Manual Testing Without Documentation**
    - ✅ Flexible testing approach
    - ❌ Inconsistent coverage、no systematic documentation、no automation
3. **Comprehensive Chrome DevTools Automation with Detailed Scenarios**
    - ✅ Real-world user workflows、Indonesian compliance testing、automated browser testing、comprehensive documentation
    - ❌ More time-intensive than unit tests、requires browser automation setup

**Decision**: Option 3 - Comprehensive Chrome DevTools Automation with Detailed Scenarios

**Rationale**:

-   Production systems require end-to-end workflow validation beyond unit testing
-   Chrome DevTools automation provides superior form interaction testing compared to traditional testing
-   Indonesian business compliance requires thorough testing of currency formatting、tax calculations、and accounting standards
-   Comprehensive documentation enables future maintenance and systematic testing
-   Critical validation issues often stem from UI/UX inconsistencies that only browser testing can catch

**Implementation**:

**Critical Issues Identified & Resolved**:

-   **Purchase Order Hidden Fields Bug**: Purchase Orders were missing HTML hidden input fields for `vat_amount` and `wtax_amount`、causing form validation failures
-   **Root Cause**: Sales Orders had correct hidden fields、but Purchase Orders were missing these fields in HTML template
-   **Solution**: Added missing hidden inputs to Purchase Order template: `<input type="hidden" name="lines[${i-1}][vat_amount]" value="${data?.vat_amount || '0.00'}">`
-   **Verification**: Error messages now show proper validation structure instead of form reset issues
