-   Challenge: Provide quick HTML views for AR/AP aging and cash ledger; include party names in aging JSON; give feedback for queued PDFs and a central downloads list.
-   Solution: Added `/reports/ar-aging`, `/reports/ap-aging`, `/reports/cash-ledger` HTML pages with `reports.view` guard; updated `ReportService` to include `customer_name`/`vendor_name` in aging; injected meta `pdf_url` and JS polling banner; created `/downloads` page listing stored PDFs.
-   Key Learning: Keep reports dual-mode (HTML+JSON) for flexibility; simple polling with HEAD requests is sufficient when storage is local.

### [2025-09-08] Period close controls implemented ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### [2025-09-08] Minimal AR scaffolding (Sales Invoice) ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### [2025-09-08] Minimal AP scaffolding (Purchase Invoice) + PDF placeholders ‚úÖ COMPLETE

-   ### [2025-09-08] SO/PO/GRN upstream docs + invoice prefill ‚úÖ COMPLETE

-   Challenge: Need lightweight upstream documents to capture orders/receipts and accelerate invoice creation.
-   Solution: Added Sales Orders, Purchase Orders, Goods Receipts with list/create/show, DataTables endpoints, and "Create Invoice" actions to prefill invoice forms.
-   Key Learning: Prefill from upstream docs reduces data entry and preserves operational trail without complex workflows.

-   ### [2025-09-08] Party balance statement pages (AR/AP) ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### [2025-09-09] Withholding recap per-invoice rounding ‚úÖ COMPLETE

-   Challenge: Totals mismatched when aggregating only at vendor level.
-   Solution: Compute per-invoice withholding as `ROUND(SUM(lines√órate),2)` and then sum by vendor in `ReportService::getWithholdingRecap()`.
-   Key Learning: Rounding policy must be explicit; per-invoice matches typical tax documents and minimizes disputes.

### [2025-09-09] Phase 8 SO/PO/GRN maturity ‚úÖ COMPLETE (core)

-   ### [2025-09-09] Routes split by domain ‚úÖ COMPLETE

-   Challenge: `web.php` was large and mixed multiple domains.
-   Solution: Moved grouped routes into `routes/web/reports.php`, `routes/web/journals.php`, `routes/web/orders.php`, and `routes/web/ar_ap.php`; required from `web.php` inside auth group.
-   Key Learning: Route modularization reduces merge conflicts and speeds navigation.

-   Challenge: Need operational status flow, linkage to invoices, reporting exports, and quantity visibility.
-   Solution: Added approve/close (SO/PO) and receive (GRN); added linkage columns and prefill IDs; list filters + CSV for SO/PO/GRN; ordered vs received summaries on PO/GRN.
-   Key Learning: Small upstream artifacts (status + linkage + basic exports) deliver large UX gains without complex workflows.

-   Challenge: Provide quick per-party balances for reconciliation and follow-up.
-   Solution: Added `/reports/ar-balances` and `/reports/ap-balances` with CSV/PDF exports and links to aging drill-downs; added to Reports menu.
-   Key Learning: Summary pages complement aging for action-oriented reconciliation; exports enable offline sharing.

-   Challenge: Provide AP flow mirroring AR and printable placeholders for documents.
-   Solution: Added PurchaseInvoice(+lines) models/migrations; controller CRUD/post/print; routes/views; seeded AP permissions; added print views for AR/AP; GeneratePdfJob stub.
-   Key Learning: Reuse PostingService and seeded CoA accounts for consistent postings; keep print views simple until PDF engine is added.

-   Challenge: Provide a working AR flow to create balanced journals from sales invoices.
-   Solution: Added SalesInvoice(+lines) models, migrations, controller with CRUD and post; seeded AR permissions; routes/views; posting test ensures balance; PostingService used for journal creation.
-   Key Learning: Keep AR posting minimal and leverage existing PostingService; use CoA seeded codes for AR (1.1.4), Revenue (4.1.x), and PPN Keluaran (2.1.2).

-   Challenge: Needed mechanism to prevent postings into closed periods and to manage month close/open.
-   Solution: Added `PeriodCloseService`, UI/routes for `/periods`, permissions (`periods.view`, `periods.close`), and PostingService guard to block closed periods.
-   Key Learning: Enforcing at service layer keeps tests simple and avoids DB trigger complexity; add UI to promote visibility and control.

-   Challenge: Inconsistency with decision to disable self-registration; journals reverse action authorized with wrong permission and DataTables actions broke due to missing id.
-   Solution: Removed `/register` routes; changed controller authorization to `journals.reverse`; added `j.id` to DataTables select.
-   Key Learning: Keep route-policy decisions enforced in code; ensure DataTables selects include keys used by action renderers.

### [2025-09-07] FK integrity pass and resilient migrations ‚úÖ COMPLETE

-   Challenge: Duplicate FK errors during iterative dev and test runs.
-   Solution: Added idempotent FK migration and follow-up migration to enforce `projects.fund_id` and dimension FKs without dropping missing keys.
-   Key Learning: Make FK changes additive and tolerant; use migrate:fresh in dev.

### [2025-09-07] RBAC granularity for Journals and reports tests ‚úÖ COMPLETE

-   Challenge: Need least-privilege control and verified reporting outputs.
-   Solution: Applied per-action permissions on journals routes; added feature tests for Trial Balance totals and GL Detail filters.
-   Key Learning: Route-level permissions simplify audits; tests prevent regressions.

### [2025-09-07] Auth approach set to AdminLTE-only ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### [2025-09-07] Journal numbering and timezone policy ‚úÖ COMPLETE

-   Challenge: Provide human-friendly unique journal identifiers and consistent regional time display.
-   Solution: Implemented `journal_no` with `JNL-YYYYMM-######` scheme; UTC storage with Asia/Singapore display.
-   Key Learning: ID-based, date-prefixed numbers are robust without extra sequence infra; keep storage UTC.

-   Challenge: Inconsistent auth docs (Breeze vs AdminLTE) and duplicate scaffolding risk.
-   Solution: Standardize on AdminLTE-only login/logout; no public register/reset. Guard routes with `auth` and Spatie permissions.
-   Key Learning: Keep a single UX/auth path to reduce complexity; admin-managed users fit RBAC workflow.

### [2025-09-07] Phase 1 Foundation Setup ‚úÖ COMPLETE

-   Challenge: Build a compliant Yayasan bookkeeping base quickly with double-entry and RBAC.
-   Solution: Laravel 12 + Spatie Permission + AdminLTE + Breeze. Implemented GL tables, dimensions, seeders (CoA, tax, funds/projects, roles), reports (trial balance, GL detail).
-   Key Learning: Defer some FK constraints to avoid migration ordering issues; add HasRoles to `User` early to prevent seeder errors.

### [2025-09-07] Admin RBAC UI refactor & DataTables init fix ‚úÖ COMPLETE

-   Challenge: Modal forms hindered UX and DataTables scripts didn't fire on admin pages.
-   Solution: Switched Users/Roles to dedicated create/edit pages with route/controller updates; standardized scripts via `@section('scripts')` and added `@stack('scripts')` support in layout.
-   Key Learning: Keep script rendering conventions consistent across layouts and pages to avoid silent JS init failures; prefer page forms for complex CRUD.

### [2025-01-15] Journal approval workflow technical fixes and dashboard enhancement ‚úÖ COMPLETE

-   Challenge: Fix technical issues with Journal Approval page where Approve button was not working due to JavaScript/SweetAlert integration problems, and add user role information to dashboard for better user context.
-   Solution: (1) Fixed SweetAlert integration in journals/approval/index.blade.php by enhancing JavaScript with proper confirmation dialog styling, loading indicators, and error handling. Added confirmButtonColor, cancelButtonColor, and reverseButtons for better UX. (2) Fixed model namespace issues in JournalLine.php by correcting Project, Fund, and Department model references to use \App\Models\Dimensions\ namespace instead of \App\Models\. (3) Enhanced JournalApprovalController.php with proper relationship loading and error handling. (4) Added comprehensive User Information card to dashboard.blade.php displaying user name, email, username, roles (as badges), permissions count, and login timestamp. (5) Tested complete approval workflow: Accountant creates draft journal ‚Üí Approver reviews ‚Üí Approver approves with SweetAlert confirmation ‚Üí Journal status changes from draft to posted ‚Üí Database updated with posted_by and posted_at timestamps ‚Üí Success notification displayed ‚Üí Journal disappears from approval list.
-   Key Learning: JavaScript integration issues often stem from missing dependencies or incorrect API usage. SweetAlert2 requires proper initialization and styling for optimal user experience. Model namespace consistency is critical for relationship loading - all related models must use correct namespaces. Dashboard user context improves system usability by providing immediate role and permission visibility. Complete workflow testing validates end-to-end functionality and ensures proper status transitions.

### [2025-01-15] ERP system comprehensive testing and critical fixes implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETE

-   Challenge: Test ERP application using training scenarios and fix critical issues preventing proper functionality for different user roles (Approver, Cashier, Auditor).
-   Solution: (1) Identified and fixed route conflict in assets module where `/assets/depreciation` was conflicting with `/assets/{asset}` route by moving depreciation routes inside assets group before the `/{asset}` route. (2) Fixed AssetDepreciationController constructor dependency injection issues by properly injecting PostingService and PeriodCloseService parameters required by FixedAssetService. (3) Enhanced Cashier role permissions by adding `ar.receipts.view`, `ar.receipts.create`, `ap.payments.view`, `ap.payments.create`, and `customers.view` permissions. (4) Expanded Auditor role permissions with comprehensive read-only access to all modules including `journals.view`, `ar.invoices.view`, `ap.invoices.view`, `assets.view`, `customers.view`, `vendors.view`, and all master data permissions. (5) Fixed AssetImportController method naming conflict by renaming `validate()` method to `validateImport()` to avoid conflict with parent Controller's validate method. (6) Updated RolePermissionSeeder.php with comprehensive permissions and cleared permission cache to ensure changes take effect.
-   Key Learning: Route conflicts in Laravel occur when specific routes are placed after catch-all routes (like `/{asset}`). Controller dependency injection requires proper parameter matching for service constructors. Role-based permissions must be comprehensive to enable proper functionality - missing view permissions prevent menu access even when create permissions exist. Method naming conflicts in controllers can cause fatal errors and must be resolved by renaming conflicting methods. Permission cache must be cleared after seeder updates to ensure changes take effect immediately.
